2. Submit the encrypted cipher along with the ElGamal keys used to encrypt this plaintext .
3. For assignment 5,  Write a simple socket-based chat program that uses ElGamal with DES or AES (your choice). 
   As usual, allow the user to specify the bit-length for the prime used in ElGamal and also
   the secret key for DES/AES. Implement a system that simply encrypts single ASCII characters.
